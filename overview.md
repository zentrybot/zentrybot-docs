# ðŸ’Ž Platform Overview

## What We Do

ZentryBot is a platform that combines NFTs, bots, and advertising for XRPL projects. We help crypto projects get noticed and give NFT holders real utility while making money from it.

## Problems We Fix

### For Crypto Projects

* **Hard to Get Noticed**: Too many projects competing for attention
* **Marketing Costs Too Much**: Expensive ads with no guarantee they work
* **Low Community Activity**: Hard to keep people engaged
* **Wrong People**: Reaching people who don't actually care

### For Community Managers

* **Too Much Manual Work**: Checking tokens and NFTs by hand takes forever
* **Need Better Tools**: Current tools don't work well for crypto communities
* **Want Real-time Info**: Need instant updates when things happen

## How We Fix It

ZentryBot has three main parts that work together:

### 1. NFTs That Actually Do Something

* **1,717 Zentry NFTs**: Limited number so they stay valuable
* **Lifetime Access**: Buy once, use forever

* **Real Use**: Not just pictures - they actually work

### 2. Telegram Bots

* **Track Tokens**: Watch prices and trading volume
* **Track NFTs**: See floor prices and sales
* **Manage Groups**: Admin tools and permissions
* **One Bot, Many Groups**: Efficient setup

### 3. ZENT Tokens

* **Buy Ads**: Need tokens to advertise on our network
