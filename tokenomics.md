## How The Economics Work

### Token Burning

#### What Gets Burned
- **Ad Fees**: Some of the ZENT spent on ads gets destroyed
- **Platform Fees**: Part of other platform fees also burned
- **Less Supply**: Fewer tokens over time
- **Potential Value**: Less supply might mean higher prices

#### Burn Rate
- We burn 10-25% of platform revenue
- Community can vote to change this rate
- Happens automatically each month

### Revenue Sharing

#### How Staking Rewards Work
- **Revenue Source**: Money from ads and platform fees
- **Your Share**: Based on how much you stake vs everyone else
- **Payment**: Monthly rewards to stakers
- **Reinvest**: Can automatically stake your rewards

#### Simple Math
- Your reward = (Your stake รท Total staked) ร Monthly revenue pool
- Revenue pool = 60-80% of platform revenue
- More you stake = bigger share of rewards

## How Value Grows

### The Cycle

1. **More Users**: More projects buy ads on the platform
2. **More Demand**: Higher demand for ZENT tokens
3. **Price Goes Up**: More demand might increase token price
4. **More Staking**: Higher prices encourage more staking
5. **Better Platform**: Revenue funds improvements
6. **Repeat**: Better platform attracts more users

### Why It Might Work
- **Real Use**: Value comes from actual platform usage
- **Revenue**: Growth funded by real business income
- **Shared Success**: Users benefit when platform grows
- **Long-term**: Built for sustainability, not quick gains
