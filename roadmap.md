# Development Roadmap

## What We're Building

ZentryBot is building a simple advertising network for crypto communities. We're taking it step by step, focusing on what actually works rather than overpromising.

## Phase 1: Foundation âœ…
**Status: Done**

### What We Built
- 1,717 Zentry NFTs for lifetime access
- Dashboard that connects with Xaman wallet
- Telegram bots that track tokens and NFTs
- Bot network serving communities

Basically, we got the core stuff working. People can buy an NFT, connect their wallet, and get bots for their Telegram groups.

## Phase 2: $ZENT Token & Ads (Q4 2025)
**Status: Working on it**

### $ZENT Token
- Creating 1,000,000 $ZENT tokens total
- 80% goes to liquidity pool (locked)
- 15% for team (4-year vesting)
- 5% airdrop to NFT holders based on mint rank
- No presale, no private sale

### Advertising Platform
- People pay $ZENT to advertise in our bot network
- Stakers get a share of revenue
- Some tokens get burned with each transaction
- Simple campaign creation tools

### Goals
- Get the token launched
- Start making money from ads
- Grow to 100+ communities

## Phase 3: Staking & More Platforms (Q1 2026)
**Status: Planned**

### Staking Platform
- Launch $ZENT staking so holders can earn passive income
- Revenue from ads gets shared with stakers
- Pretty straightforward - stake tokens, earn money

### Discord Bots
- Add Discord support (lots of people asked for this)
- Same bots, different platform
- NFT holders get access to both Telegram and Discord bots

## Phase 4: Analytics & Growth (Q2-Q3 2026)
**Status: Planned**

### Analytics Dashboard
- Build proper analytics for advertisers
- Show them if their ads are actually working
- Track clicks, engagement, ROI - the usual stuff

### Scale Up

## Community Stuff

### How We Work With the Community
- Listen to feedback and feature requests
- NFT holders get early access to new features
- Regular updates on Discord and social media
- Keep things transparent

### Governance
- Right now: team makes decisions with community input
- Later: token holders vote on big decisions
- Eventually: community runs everything

### Staying Transparent
- Regular updates on progress
- Open about what's working and what isn't
- Share revenue numbers when we start making money
- No BS marketing speak

## Bottom Line

We're building a simple advertising network for crypto communities. The plan is straightforward:

1. **NFTs**: 1,717 total, gives you lifetime access
2. **Token**: 1,000,000 $ZENT total, no presale nonsense
3. **Revenue**: Real money from ads, shared with stakers
4. **Growth**: Step by step, no crazy promises

### Why This Works
- Solves a real problem (crypto projects need promotion)
- Makes money from actual services, not speculation
- Limited supply creates value for early supporters
- Simple model that's easy to understand

We're not trying to revolutionize everything. Just building useful tools that crypto communities actually want, and sharing the profits with people who support us early.

That's it. No fluff, no unrealistic promises. Just a solid plan to build something useful.
