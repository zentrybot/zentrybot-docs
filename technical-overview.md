# Technical Overview

## What We Actually Built

ZentryBot is a web app with some Telegram bots. We use standard web technologies and keep things simple. No need to overcomplicate it.

## Frontend

### What We Use
- **Next.js**: For the website and dashboard
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling (it's popular and works)
- **React**: Standard React components
- **Xaman Integration**: To connect XRPL wallets

### How It Works
- Users connect their wallet
- Dashboard shows their NFTs and bot status
- Pretty standard web app stuff

### Backend

### What We Use
- **Node.js**: For the API server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (reliable and works well)
- **Telegram API**: To create and manage bots
- **XRPL**: To check NFT ownership

### How It Works
- API handles user requests
- Database stores user data and bot configs
- Bots run independently and post to Telegram groups
- We check the XRPL to verify NFT ownership

### Bot Network

### How Bots Work
- Each NFT holder gets one bot for their Telegram group
- Bots track token prices and NFT sales
- They post updates when stuff happens
- We use webhooks to update bot settings

### Technical Details
- Bots run on our servers
- They use Telegram's API to send messages
- We handle rate limits so bots don't get banned
- Basic error handling and logging

## Security

### Basic Security Stuff
- **No Private Keys**: We don't store your wallet keys

## Performance

### Making Things Fast
- **Next.js**: Handles most optimization automatically
