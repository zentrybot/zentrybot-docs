# How We Make Money

## The Basic Idea

ZentryBot makes money from real services, not just selling tokens. We built tools people actually use, and we charge for them. Simple.

## How We Earn Revenue

### 1. NFT Sales (Starting Money)
- **1,717 Zentry NFTs**: Limited number, sold once
- **Lifetime Access**: Buy once, use forever
- **Fair Price**: Not trying to get rich quick
- **Instant Access**: Works right after you buy

### 2. Advertising Fees
- **ZENT Payments**: Projects pay ZENT tokens to advertise
- **Campaign Fees**: We take a cut from advertising campaigns
- **Fair Pricing**: Based on actual reach and results
- **Growth**: More users = more ad revenue

### 3. Platform Fees
- **Bot Setup**: Small fees for advanced features
- **Analytics**: Better data costs a bit extra
- **API Access**: For developers who want to integrate
- **Custom Work**: Special implementations for big projects

### 4. Staking Rewards
- **ZENT Staking**: Stake tokens, earn from platform fees
- **Yield Farming**: Extra ways to earn with your tokens
- **Liquidity**: Rewards for providing trading liquidity
- **Voting**: Token holders help make decisions

## How Growth Works

### The Cycle

1. **More Users**: More communities use our bots
2. **More Advertisers**: Projects want to reach our users
3. **More Revenue**: We earn from advertising fees
4. **Better Rewards**: Stakers get more from revenue sharing
5. **Better Platform**: We reinvest in improvements
6. **Repeat**: Better platform attracts more users

### Simple Growth Loop

```
More Users → More Ads → More Revenue → Better Rewards → Better Platform → More Users
```

## Why It's Sustainable

### Real Business Model
- **Actual Revenue**: We make money from services, not just token sales
- **Real Use**: ZENT tokens are needed for platform features
- **Community Benefits**: Users earn when platform succeeds
- **Market Independent**: Business works even in bear markets

### Token Economics
- **Token Burn**: We burn some tokens from fees
- **Less Supply**: Fewer tokens over time
- **Value Protection**: Trying to protect token holder value
- **Balance**: Keep token economics healthy
